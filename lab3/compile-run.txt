The program was tested (compiled) using Developer Command Prompt for VS2017.

First the source code needs to be compiled using : "cl /c MyFA1.cpp" and "cl /c MyFA2.cpp". 

Then the .obj filles need to be linked: "link MyFA1.obj" and "link MyFA2.obj".

This will result in an executable file which can be used to run the program.
